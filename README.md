# NYC-Schools-Perceptions


### **Context:**  
In this project we're going to take a look at and analyze some surveys designed to gauge parent, student and teacher perceptions of the quality of New York City schools. Survey results provide insight into a school's learning environment and contribute of diversification that goes beyond test scores. 

### **Objective:**  
Our goal in this project is to investigate on how student, parent and teacher perceptions appear to be related to demographic and academic success metrics and find out if students, parents and teachers have similar perceptions of NYC school quality. 

### **Dataset:**  
We'll work on several datasets which are listed below:

- Survey data Dictionary.xls
- masterfile11_gened_final.xlsx
- masterfile11_gened_final.txt
- masterfile11_d75_final.xlsx
- masterfile11_d75_final.txt
- combined.csv

The first file, Survey data Dictionary.xls, contains metadata that will be useful for cleaning and preparing the survey data for analysis.  
The next two files, masterfile11_gened_final.xlsx and masterfile11_gened_final.txt, contain survey data for "general education" schools - those that do not serve populations with special needs.  
The files, masterfile11_d75_final.xlsx and masterfile11_d75_final.txt, contain survey data for District 75 Schools, which provide exceptional education support for children with special needs such as learning and physical disabilities.  
I downloaded the first five files from this [link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8).  
The last file combined.csv, contains a list of schools with information about location, test exam scores, class sizes...  
This last file was downloaded from [here](https://data.world/dataquest/nyc-schools-data/workspace/file?filename=combined.csv).
